# Loan Default Risk Predictor Using FOIA Bank Data

# Problem Statement
A bank has experienced an excess amount of approved loans defaulting. This has led to financial losses due to several reasons:
    1. Principal loss - Defaulted loans may only pay a portion of what was lent out.
    2. Interest Income Loss - Bank misses on future interest payments. 
    3. Higher credit risk - Defaulted loans implies poor credit risk assessment, which may dissuade investors and lead to regulatory implications.

The Loan Default Risk Predictor (LDRP) project aims to correctly assess the risk of a consumer loan default using data from the LendersClub, the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform, centralized in San Francisco, California. 

By assessing high-risk loans in advance, we reduce the amount of loans defaulting and thus minimize financial loss.
