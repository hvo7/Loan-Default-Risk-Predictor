# Loan Default Risk Predictor Using FOIA Bank Data

The project aims to predict the risk of a consumer loan default using data from U.S. financial institutions to help flag high-risk loans before a default happens. 

*Example: For this auto loan in 2025 in Louisiana, what is the probabiltiy that it will default within the next x months?"*

By assessing high-risk loans in advance, we can help lenders take proactive measures to mitigate losses and thus increase profitaability.

*Note that because this model is related to loans, we must be careful and consider any potential disciriminatory bias based on protected attributes*
